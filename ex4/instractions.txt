in ex4 we added gradle support 
plz notice that this is cmd running gradle and it does not depends on eclipse 
to run the gui plz write "gradle runGui " or use the wrapper with "gradlew runGui"
currently the sql pull takes comb file lines and convert it to UnitedCsv file and then do the tasks 
**plz enter workspace before pressing import**

all the other tasks works fine use "gradle/w tasks -all " to view 

to create javadoc type "gradle/w javadoc "


to create jar type "gradle jar " its will appear at folder "bulid/libs "
